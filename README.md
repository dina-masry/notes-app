# 📝 Notes App: A Flutter Project
## ✨ Project Overview
Welcome to the Notes App repository! This project is a new Flutter application designed for creating and managing notes. Built with Flutter, it aims to provide a fluid, intuitive, and cross-platform experience for users to jot down thoughts, organize ideas, and keep track of important information. Flutter's capability allows us to deliver a natively compiled application for various platforms from a single, efficient codebase.
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Flutter: The primary framework for building the cross-platform user interface.

- Dart: The programming language used for all Flutter development.

- SQLite: Utilized for local, persistent storage of notes directly on the device, ensuring data availability even offline.

- BLoC (Business Logic Component): Employed for state management, effectively separating the business logic from the UI to create a predictable and scalable application.
